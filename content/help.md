## Advanced Search Help
Variants are identified using [HGVS nomenclature](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/), a standard created by the Human Genome Variation Society.  Most genetic test results are reported in HGVS nomenclature. This nomenclature describes a variant by indicating (1) a reference sequence, (2) what kind of sequence it is (genomic, cDNA or protein), (3) the position of the variant in relation this reference sequence, and (4) the nucloetide or protein differences between the variant and the reference sequence.  For example, _NM_007294.3:c.5053A>G_ indicates a variant relative to reference sequence _NM_007294.3_, which is a cDNA sequence (as indicated by _c_), that the variant is in position 5053, and that it involves changing an _A_ to a _G_.  

# Table Columns

#### Gene

The Gene column displays the name of the gene on which the variant was found.  This will be either BRCA1 or BRCA2.

#### HGVS cDNA

Nucleotide change expressed according to nomenclature used by [BIC](http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/), namely using nucleotide numbering from nucleotide 1 of the full gene sequence (Genbank: U14680/ BRCA1; U43746/ BRCA2) not the ATG initiator codon, and without renaming of the BRCA1 185del AG and the BRCA1 5382insC mutations, following the universal use of the incorrect base numbers in the literature.  For example, _c.15A>G_ indicates a change of _A_ to _G_ in nucleotide position 15.

#### HGVS Protein

The protein-level change (if any) that would be introduced by this variant.  HGVS notation indicates the position of the variant within the reference protein sequence, and the change that would be introduced by this variant.  For example, _p.(Tyr15His)_ indicates a change of _Tyr_ (Tyrosine) to _His_ (Histidine) at amino acid 15.  The notation _p.?_ indicates a variant is not within the protein-coding portions of the gene.

#### BIC Nucleotide

Nucleotide change expressed according to nomenclature used by BIC ([http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/](http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/)), namely using nucleotide numbering from the first nucleotide of the full gene sequence, in contrast to HGVS notation which begins numbering relative to the start of the protein-coding portion of the sequence. 

#### BIC Protein

Protein amino acid change expressed according to nomenclature used by BIC ([http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/](http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/)).  When this column is blank, it indicates that the variant is not in a protein-coding position within the gene. 

#### Genomic Coordinate

Position of the variant in the reference genome, relative to the positive DNA strand.


#### Pathogenicity
The Pathogenicity column indicates whether expert curators have determined if the variant is pathogenic or benign. 

#####What do these classifications mean?
- *Pathogenic variants* confer an increased risk of disease. 
- *Likely pathogenic variants* have good evidence to support an association with disease risk.
- *Likely benign variants* have good evidence to support no association with disease risk.
- *Benign variants* are not associated with any markedly increased risk of disease.
- *Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)* are those for which the evidence of disease risk is not clear yet, sometimes because there is not yet enough evidence to classify them as either pathogenic or benign.

#####My variant is classified pathogenic. What do I do now?

#### Source

The variants shown on this site are stored in larger genomic variant databases.  One major variant datase is [ClinVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).  This column gives the variant's ID in the ClinVar database, and contains hyperlinks showing the variant in ClinVar.

# Lollipop Plots

Lollipop plots are a tool to visualize the chromosomal position and pathogenicity classification for each variant in a gene.  Here, each circle-capped 'lollipop' indicates whether a BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant is benign (labeled in blue) or pathogenic (labeled in red).  The diameter of the circle on top of each lollipop indicates the number of unique variants that have been observed at an individual locus.  The bottom bar that runs along the x-axis of the diagram displays the position of each exon in the selected gene.  To alternate between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 lollipop charts, click the *Select Gene* button located in the upper-left hand corner of the page.
